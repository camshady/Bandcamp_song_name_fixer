# Bandcamp_song_name_fixer
Removes artist and album info from a song name in bandcamp format. 

I found it tedious to rename songs one at a time, so I made a script to do it automatically. 
Download Bandcamp_fixer.zip and extract it. 
The .exe file is not up to date.
I will publish a final executable when the python script is done. 

Changes to make include:
- adding GUI
- add ability to select multiple albums
- add ability to select whole artist
- add customisation of format

The correct source format is (eg for mp3): Artist - Album - 01 Song.mp3
The file will be renamed "01 Song.mp3". 

MAKE SURE NOT TO HAVE ANY MUSIC PLAYER OPEN WHILE USING, OR IT WILL NOT WORK.
