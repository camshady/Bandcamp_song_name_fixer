# Bandcamp_song_name_fixer
Removes artist and album info from a song name in bandcamp format. 

I found it tedious to rename songs one at a time, so I made a script to do it automatically. 
Download Bandcamp_fixer.zip and extract it. 
Open the .exe file. 
Enter library path, artist and album. 
The program will exit. 
It has either renamed all the files or they were not following the correct format. 

The correct format is (eg for mp3): Artist - Album - 01 Song.mp3
